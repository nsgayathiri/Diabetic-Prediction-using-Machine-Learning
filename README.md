# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input features using a Random Forest model. Built with Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

## Files:
- diabetes_prediction.ipynb: Main machine learning code
- health care diabetes.csv: Dataset used

## How to run:
- Open the notebook and run the cells.
- (If using Streamlit app, run `streamlit run app.py` in terminal.)
